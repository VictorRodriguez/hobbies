# filter script for CVEs in STX

Vulscan generates reports for all the CVEs discovered and valid on the STX iso.
However, according to the STX CVE policy:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/StarlingX/Security/CVE_Support_Policy

Only CVEs meeting the criteria which follows are accepted for fixing:

Criticality >= 7
Base Vector as:

AV = Network

AI = Partial or Complete

And a fix is available upstream

The script filters the json file generated by vuls scan:
