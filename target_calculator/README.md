# Target Calculator 

Create a system that calculate the slope intercept formula based on linear regresion system and return the value of X that satisfies the target Y

## Description

The slope intercept formula y = mx + b is used when you know the slope of the line to be examined and the point given is also the y intercept (0, b).
In the formula, b represents the y value of the y intercept point.

## Getting Started
